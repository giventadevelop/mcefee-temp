# Description: Create the RESTful API endpoints for managing event polls.
# Details:
Implement the following endpoints for event polls:
- GET /api/event-polls
- POST /api/event-polls
- GET /api/event-polls/{id}
- PUT /api/event-polls/{id}
- PATCH /api/event-polls/{id}
- DELETE /api/event-polls/{id}

Ensure proper validation, error handling, and JWT authentication.

# Test Strategy:
Test each endpoint with valid and invalid requests. Verify authentication and authorization are working correctly.
