Product Requirements Document (PRD)
User Registration Request & Event Attendance Workflow
1. Project Overview & Context
Based on the comprehensive SaaS Event Management System, this PRD defines the workflow for user registration requests and event attendance for free events (picnics, community gatherings) organized by tenant organizations.
System Context:

Multi-tenant SaaS platform with Clerk authentication
PostgreSQL database with tenant isolation
Spring Boot backend with JHipster framework
React/Next.js frontend
AWS S3 for media storage
Stripe for payments (future paid events)

2. User Stories & Requirements
Primary User Stories

As a new user, I want to request registration to join an organization so I can attend their events
As an admin, I want to review and approve/reject user registration requests to maintain membership quality
As an approved user, I want to register for free events with minimal friction
As an event organizer, I want to manage event attendance and check-ins efficiently
As an admin, I want to track all user activities and maintain audit logs

Secondary User Stories

As a user, I want to receive notifications about my registration status
As an admin, I want to bulk approve multiple registration requests
As an organizer, I want to export attendee lists for event planning
As a user, I want to cancel my event registration if needed
