# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1 âœ…
# Priority: high
# Description: Create API routes in Next.js to proxy requests to the backend Spring Boot API.
# Details:
Create the following API routes:
- /api/event-details/[id]
- /api/event-ticket-types (with query param support)
- /api/discount-codes (with query param support)
- /api/event-ticket-transactions

Ensure all routes follow the nextjs_api_routes.mdc pattern.

# Test Strategy:
Test each API route to ensure it correctly proxies requests to the backend and returns the expected responses.
