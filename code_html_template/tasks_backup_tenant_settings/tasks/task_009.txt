# Description: Create a reusable form component for creating and editing tenant organizations.
# Details:
Implement the TenantOrganizationForm component with:
- Form fields for all tenant organization properties
- Color picker for primary and secondary colors
- File upload for logo with preview
- Date pickers for subscription dates
- Client-side validation using React Hook Form
- Real-time validation for unique constraints
- Clear error messages and field highlighting
- Support for both create and edit modes

# Test Strategy:
Test the form with valid and invalid inputs to ensure validation works correctly. Verify that the form correctly handles both create and edit operations.
