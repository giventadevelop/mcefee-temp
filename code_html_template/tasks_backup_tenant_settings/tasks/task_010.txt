# Description: Create a reusable form component for creating and editing tenant settings.
# Details:
Implement the TenantSettingsForm component with:
- Form fields for all tenant settings properties
- Toggle switches for boolean fields
- Number inputs with validation for numeric fields
- Text areas for custom CSS/JS with syntax highlighting
- JSON editor for email provider configuration
- Client-side validation using React Hook Form
- Clear error messages and field highlighting
- Support for both create and edit modes
- Tenant organization selection dropdown

# Test Strategy:
Test the form with valid and invalid inputs to ensure validation works correctly. Verify that the form correctly handles both create and edit operations.
