# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement event registration API endpoints
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3 ✅
# Priority: high
# Description: Create API endpoints for registering for free events and managing registrations.
# Details:
Task 004 Requirements
The task file .task-master/tasks/task_004.txt requires implementing these API endpoints:
POST /api/events/:id/register - for event registration
GET /api/events/:id/guest-stats - for retrieving guest statistics
PUT /api/registrations/:id/guests/:guestId - for updating guest information
Existing API Endpoints in Swagger Documentation
The Swagger documentation (documentation/api-docs.json) already contains extensive event-related infrastructure but NOT the specific registration endpoints needed for Task 004.
✅ Available (Can Be Reused):
Event Management:
/api/event-details - CRUD operations for event details
/api/event-attendees - CRUD operations for event attendees
/api/event-attendee-guests - CRUD operations for guest management
/api/event-ticket-types - Ticket type management
/api/event-ticket-transactions - Transaction handling
/api/event-medias - Event media management
/api/event-organizers - Organizer management
/api/event-admins - Admin management
User Management:
/api/user-profiles - User profile CRUD operations
/api/user-registration-requests - User registration handling
Supporting Infrastructure:
/api/discount-codes - Discount management
/api/qr-code-usages - QR code functionality
/api/email-logs - Email communication
/api/whats-app-logs - WhatsApp communication
❌ Missing (Need to Implement):
Event Registration Endpoints:
POST /api/events/:id/register - NOT FOUND
GET /api/events/:id/guest-stats - NOT FOUND
PUT /api/registrations/:id/guests/:guestId - NOT FOUND
Public Event Access:
GET /api/events/public - NOT FOUND
GET /api/events/:id - NOT FOUND (only /api/event-details/:id exists)
Suggested Implementation Paths
1. Leverage Existing Infrastructure (Recommended)
Use existing endpoints as building blocks:
Event Details: /api/event-details for event information
Attendee Management: /api/event-attendees for registration records
Guest Management: /api/event-attendee-guests for guest details
User Profiles: /api/user-profiles for user information
Create new registration endpoints that integrate with existing tables:
Implement:
- POST /api/events/:id/register for event registration
- GET /api/events/:id/guest-stats for retrieving guest statistics
- PUT /api/registrations/:id/guests/:guestId for updating guest information
2. Database Schema Alignment
The existing Swagger shows these relevant tables are already available:
event_details ✅
event_attendee ✅
event_attendee_guest ✅
user_profile ✅
No need to create new database tables - the existing schema supports the registration workflow.
3. Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Registration Endpoints
Create POST /api/events/:id/register that:
Validates event exists via /api/event-details/:id
Creates attendee record via /api/event-attendees
Creates guest records via /api/event-attendee-guests
Links to user profile via /api/user-profiles
Phase 2: Statistics & Management
Create GET /api/events/:id/guest-stats that:
Queries /api/event-attendees?eventId.equals=:id
Aggregates guest counts from /api/event-attendee-guests
Returns summary statistics
Phase 3: Guest Updates
Create PUT /api/registrations/:id/guests/:guestId that:
Updates specific guest via /api/event-attendee-guests/:guestId
Maintains data consistency across related tables
Summary
Good News: 80% of the infrastructure is already available in the Swagger documentation.
What to Reuse: All database tables, user management, event management, and supporting services.
What to Build: Only the 3 specific registration endpoints mentioned in Task 004, leveraging the existing robust event management infrastructure.
Recommendation: Implement the new registration endpoints as thin orchestration layers that coordinate between the existing, well-established event management APIs rather than building everything from scratch.


Include logic for handling both existing and new user profiles.

# Test Strategy:
Test registration flow with various scenarios including different guest counts and special requirements. Verify guest statistics are correctly calculated.
