                    The Orthodox Church of India
                  </h2>

                  <p className="font-body text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The Malankara Orthodox Church hereafter referred to as the Orthodox Church of India 
                    or the Indian Orthodox Church, is the second largest faction of the ancient church 
                    of the St Thomas Christians in India, which stood till 1657 as a single and united 
                    Church with an indigenous character of its own. This ancient church of the St. Thomas 
                    Christians is an Apostolic Church like all other Apostolic Churches around the world 
                    and originated from the evangelical labours of St. Thomas â€“ the Apostle not only of 
                    Malabar and South India but also of India and all of Asia. In that sense this church 
                    is one of the Oldest Churches in the Christian world and also in India, because Roman 
                    Catholic Christians came to India only in the 16th century and Protestant Christians 
                    in the 18th century â€“ all following Western colonialism. The Malankara Church is an 
                    indigenous Church with a distinctive heritage and characteristics of its own, deeply 
                    rooted in Indian soil. Moreover it is a church which stood for centuries in close 
                    contact with the East Syrian Church which once flourished in the present regions of 
                    Iraq and Iran.

                    Portuguese Contact and Roman Catholic Influence
                  </h3>

                  <p className="font-body text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    In the 16th century it came in contact with the Roman Catholic Church through 
                    Portuguese colonialism, which after a century's contact and interactions resulted 
                    in the enforced domination of Roman Catholicism over the church of the St. Thomas 
                    Christians. The Synod of Udayamperoor â€“ 1599 played the decisive role in this regard. 
                    Thus this synod laid the firm foundation for all the problems which arose later on 
                    in this church. For about 54 years thereafter the St. Thomas Christians remained 
                    under Rome's occupation and then onwards in a divided state.

                    The Great Revolt of 1653
                  </h3>

                  <p className="font-body text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    In 1653 through an Oath, the St. Thomas Christians' Church as a whole overthrew 
                    their enforced subjection to Roman Catholicism and resolved to restore their freedom 
                    as a church of India and to revive their Oriental Church heritage and indigenous 
                    characteristics. But due to various pressures their unity was broken, mainly due to 
                    the overwhelming action of the Roman Catholics who had immense support from the 
                    Colonial powers; a group of the Thomas Christians were induced to the Roman Catholic 
                    side and later on became the champions in the propagation of Roman Catholicism among 
                    the Thomas Christians. Moreover they, ie, those who were taken over to the Roman 
                    Catholic side did not allow their opponents, who had discarded Rome, to travel on 
                    freely to their destination as a free church. After many years of intense tribulation, 
                    struggles and loss of faithful to the Roman Catholics, those who stood against Rome, 
                    emerged as independent Church entering into free and friendly adherence with the 
                    bishops who came from the West Syrian Patriarchate in South â€“ West Asia. This began 
                    from 1665, soon after the change in the political and colonial scenario of South India, 
                    when the Portuguese were ousted out the advent of the Dutch in the region.

                    The Mar Thoma Period
                  </h3>

                  <p className="font-body text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    This Church of the St. Thomas Christians who had freed themselves from the Roman 
                    Catholicism, were led till 1816 by Indian bishops of their own native origin and 
                    they were known by a common name â€“ Mar Thoma. It is this church, which continued 
                    thereafter under bishops known as Mar Dionysius; now known by the name the Indian 
                    Orthodox Church. During 17th, 18th and 19th centuries they were also known by some 
                    names, which in most cases were appellations imposed upon them by their opponents 
                    from time to time. These are: New party (Puthencoor), Non â€“ Romo Syrians, Malabar 
                    Syrians, Jacobite Syrians etc. After the formation of the Church's constitution in 
                    1934 the name of this church became the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. They believe 
                    that they are the faithful original descendants and real continuation of the Church 
                    of the St. Thomas Christians of India. Hence they claim they are an ancient and 
                    apostolic Church like any other apostolic Church elsewhere in the world. The Church 
                    in India is eastern in its ethos and worship and is clearly distinguished from western 
                    (Roman and Protestant) church traditions.

                    Self-Governance and Indigenous Character
                  </h3>

                  <p className="font-body text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The church is fully self-governed by its local leadership and is indigenous. No 
                    foreign leadership is allowed to rule over this church now. This elements of 
                    self-awareness always echoed whenever they were threatened during the periods of 
                    contact with Roman Catholicism, Protestantism and the West Syrians.

                    Moreover, a unique and noble feature of this church, even now is its broad vision 
                    of humanity, non-Christian religions and other ideologies. From time immemorial this 
                    Church was at peace, oneness and tranquility with the surrounding Hindu, Muslim, 
                    communities without prejudice, rivalry and fanaticism. It respected those religions 
                    and those religions too respected this church. Hindu rulers and others in recognition 
                    of the abilities of the faithful of this church and its tolerant attitude had been 
                    benevolent in granting material benefits of an everlasting nature towards this church. 
                    This church never engaged in proselytism of Hindu or Muslim brothers and that is its 
                    notable nobility in India. Its members serve in all noble spheres of life and actions 
                    of humanity all over the globe.
