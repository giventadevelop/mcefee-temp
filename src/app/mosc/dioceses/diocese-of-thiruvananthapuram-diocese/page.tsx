                      On1978, February 20th, Malankara Syrian Christian managing committee recommended a division in Kollam diocese. According to Committee's recommendation, On1979, January 1st, Kollam diocese was divided into two, namely Kollam diocese and Thiruvananthapuram(Trivandrum) diocese. After the position, Trivandrum diocese was given 94 churches and now the churches and chapels include 106 numbers. From 1986 onwards, the orthodox Center at Ulloor has served as the bishop house.
In 2010 a new diocese in the name of Kottarakkara Punalur Diocese was created after dividing the Thiruvananthapuram Diocese. The are 46 parishes in the diocese after the division.
