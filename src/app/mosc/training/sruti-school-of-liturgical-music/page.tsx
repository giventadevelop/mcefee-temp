                The Sruti School of Liturgical Music is the realization of a long-cherished desire of the Orthodox Theological Seminary to effect a systematised and organised form to the music and hymnody of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. A prime objective of the institution is to foster the integration of the existing music in the Church with the indigenous music, so as to bring about an authentic Indian worship service in the Church. Since its inception, these objectives have been enlarged in scope to embrace not only the teaching of Eastern Orthodox Church Music, but also Karnatic, Western and Instrumental Music.
              </p>
              <p>
                The School began functioning with an informal inauguration by H.H. Moran Mar Baselius Mar Thoma Mathews I, the former Catholicos, in September, 1988. The success of this initial project can be measured by the fact that fifty (50) students participated, completing the course involving the basics of music, such as its theory, musical notation liturgical and instrumental music. The programme proved to be immensely helpful in assisting the local parishes to organise their services through the assistance of these students.
              </p>
              <p>
                The formal inauguration of the School of Liturgical music was held on 9th January, 1989 at the Orthodox Theological Seminary. His Holiness Theoktist, the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church, was the Chief guest and inaugurated the School. The first batch of students was officially enrolled in the two year diploma course in April 1989.

            Syriac Music

              Syriac belongs to the family of Semitic language and its development can be traced back to its source the Aramaic language around the second century A.D. At one time it was the vernacular of Syria and its adjacent regions. Today, however, its usage is restricted to the worship and liturgy of the Eastern Churches in these areas. Due to the many contacts between and the influence of these churches on the nascent Malankara church, Syriac became the dominant liturgical language of the Malankara Christians. This accounts for the popular designation "Syrian Christians".
            </p>
            <p>
              The fundamental principles of Syriac Music are based on the octo-echoes (eight modes or eight colours). The use of these modes are determined by the liturgical calendar, such as the feasts associated with the incarnation, the feasts in commemoration of St.Mary and the saints. For instance, Christmas and Easter use the first mode, on the feast of Epiphany we use the second, the feast day of saints use the eighth mode and the feast day of the departed Church leaders and fathers use the 7th (seventh) mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to fully appreciate the church's liturgy, the study of Syriac Music is indispensable. Melodious and strongly influenced by the ascetical practice of the church, Syriac music has evolved into a sophisticated system capable of uplifting the worshippers to a blessed experience of God.
