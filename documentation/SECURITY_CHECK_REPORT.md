# Security Check Report - Pre-Push Audit

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Safe to Push
**Audited By:** Claude Code

## Summary

A pre-push security audit was performed to detect any credentials or secrets that could prevent pushing to the remote git repository. One critical issue was found and resolved.

---

## Critical Issue Found (RESOLVED)

### üö® Issue: Clerk API Keys Exposed in Git

**File:** `.clerk/.tmp/keyless.json`

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Details:**
- File contained real Clerk test API keys
- Keys were tracked in git history
- Potential exposure if pushed to public repository

**Credentials Found:**
```json
{
  "publishableKey": "pk_test_***",
  "secretKey": "sk_test_***",
  "claimUrl": "https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps/claim?token=orc912sjabj0f86b2xgsjh2zv73do0buaazy5ke7"
}
```

**Remediation Taken:**
1. ‚úÖ Removed file from git tracking: `git rm --cached .clerk/.tmp/keyless.json`
2. ‚úÖ Added `.clerk/` directory to `.gitignore`
3. ‚úÖ Verified file is now ignored

**Recommendation:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Rotate these Clerk API keys in your Clerk dashboard since they were exposed in git history:
- Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps/app_2vBdZIlTLqaEDdb54M0ISIbNJT9/instances/ins_***/api-keys
- Generate new test keys
- Update your local `.env.local` file

## Files Scanned

### ‚úÖ Safe Files (No Real Credentials)

All the following files contain only:
- Placeholder examples (`sk_test_...`, `pk_test_...`, `whsec_...`)
- Documentation examples
- Template configurations

**Documentation Files (Safe):**
- `documentation/domain_agnostic_payment/PRD.md` - Example credentials only
- `documentation/domain_agnostic_payment/BACKEND_REFACTORING.md` - Code samples with placeholders
- `documentation/domain_agnostic_payment/FRONTEND_REFACTORING.md` - Example keys
- `documentation/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Template examples
- `.env.example` - Example file (safe to commit)

**Code Files (Safe):**
- All code files use environment variables via `process.env.*`
- No hardcoded credentials found in source code

### ‚úÖ Protected Files (Already in .gitignore)

The following files are properly ignored and won't be committed:
- `.env` - Local environment variables
- `.env.local` - Local development settings
- `.env.production` - Production credentials
- `.env.local.tmp_to_prod` - Temporary production config
- `.clerk/` - Clerk temporary files (now added)

---

## Git Status Summary

### Files Ready to Commit

**Modified Files:** 71 files total
- Task master files: 20 modified task files
- SQL files: Multiple schema and migration scripts
- Documentation: PRDs, guides, summaries
- Code files: Various fixes and improvements

**New Untracked Directories (Safe to Add):**
- `documentation/domain_agnostic_payment/` - New payment documentation ‚úÖ
- `documentation/authentication_clerk/` - Auth documentation ‚úÖ
- `documentation/backend_implementation/` - Backend guides ‚úÖ
- `documentation/deployment/` - Deployment guides ‚úÖ
- `backend_reference_code/` - Reference code samples ‚úÖ

**Deleted Files:**
- `.clerk/.tmp/keyless.json` - Removed (contained credentials)
- 8 task files (task_021 through task_028)

---

## Security Best Practices Applied

### ‚úÖ 1. .gitignore Configuration
Updated `.gitignore` to include:
```gitignore
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.development
.env.production
.env.production.*
.env.local*

# Clerk credentials
.clerk/
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Credential Management
- All API keys stored in `.env` files (ignored)
- Code uses `process.env.*` for runtime access
- No credentials hardcoded in source files
- Example files use placeholders only

### ‚úÖ 3. Documentation Safety
- All documentation uses example credentials
- Format: `sk_test_...`, `pk_live_***`, `whsec_***`
- Safe to commit without exposing real keys

---

## Recommendations for Future

### 1. Use Environment Variables
Always use environment variables for:
- API keys (Stripe, Clerk, PayPal)
- Database credentials
- Webhook secrets
- OAuth client secrets

### 2. Never Commit
‚ùå Never commit files containing:
- `.env` files (except `.env.example`)
- `config.json` with credentials
- Private keys or certificates
- Database dumps with real data

### 3. Pre-Commit Hooks (Optional)
Consider adding a pre-commit hook to scan for secrets:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
npm install --save-dev husky
npx husky install
```

### 4. Clerk Key Rotation
Since the test keys were exposed in git history:
1. Rotate keys in Clerk dashboard (link above)
2. Update `.env.local` with new keys
3. Consider using different test keys per developer

### 5. Git History Cleanup (Optional)
If this repository will be made public, consider cleaning git history:
```bash
# Use git-filter-repo or BFG Repo-Cleaner
# This is advanced and should be done carefully
# Consult: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository
```
