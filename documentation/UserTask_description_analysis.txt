IDEAL STRING LENGTH IF CHANGED TO String maxlength():
====================================================

RECOMMENDATION: String maxlength(4096)
======================================
Why 4096 characters (4KB):
1. Task descriptions can be comprehensive and detailed
2. Step-by-step instructions require substantial text
3. Context and background information adds length
4. Resource requirements and dependencies need explanation
5. Quality standards and expectations require detail
6. Links and references add character count
7. Future extensibility for complex task workflows

Example Description Size Breakdown:
- Basic task overview: ~200-500 characters
- Detailed requirements: +500-1000 characters
- Step-by-step instructions: +500-1000 characters
- Context and background: +300-800 characters
- Resource requirements: +200-500 characters
- Quality standards: +200-400 characters
- Links and references: +100-300 characters
- Total recommended: 4KB (4096 characters)

ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
============================

Conservative Approach:
- String maxlength(2048) - 2KB
- Sufficient for basic task descriptions
- Good for simple, straightforward tasks
- More storage efficient

- String maxlength(4096) - 4KB
- Handles comprehensive task descriptions
- Room for detailed instructions
- Reasonable storage usage

Aggressive Approach:

FINAL RECOMMENDATION: String maxlength(4096)
============================================
This provides:
✅ Sufficient space for comprehensive task descriptions
✅ Room for detailed instructions and requirements
✅ Context and background information
