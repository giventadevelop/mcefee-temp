# Git Push Fix - Commands to Run

## üö® Issue Resolved
GitHub rejected push due to exposed Google OAuth credentials in documentation.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed
**File:** `documentation/oauth/CLERK_SDK_OAUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`

**Changed lines 239-240 from:**
```
3. ‚úÖ Client ID: `[EXPOSED_CLIENT_ID].apps.googleusercontent.com`
4. ‚úÖ Client Secret: `GOCSPX-[EXPOSED_SECRET]`
```

**To:**
```
3. ‚úÖ Client ID: `[REDACTED].apps.googleusercontent.com` (stored in Clerk dashboard)
4. ‚úÖ Client Secret: `GOCSPX-[REDACTED]` (stored in Clerk dashboard)
```

## üìã Commands to Run Now

### Step 1: Force Push (Required because we amended the commit)
```bash
git push origin feature_Common_Clerk --force-with-lease
```

**Why `--force-with-lease`?**
- We amended the last commit to remove credentials
- This changes the commit hash
- `--force-with-lease` is safer than `--force` (won't overwrite if someone else pushed)

### Alternative (if force-with-lease fails):
```bash
git push origin feature_Common_Clerk --force
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Rotate These Credentials

Since these Google OAuth credentials were exposed in git history, you should rotate them:

### 1. Go to Google Cloud Console
https://console.cloud.google.com/

### 2. Navigate to your project ‚Üí Credentials

### 3. Delete the exposed credentials:
- The exposed Google OAuth Client ID (previously shown in documentation)
- The exposed Google OAuth Client Secret (previously shown in documentation)

### 4. Create new OAuth 2.0 credentials

### 5. Update in Clerk Dashboard
- Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com/
- Navigate to: Social Connections ‚Üí Google
- Update with new Client ID and Secret

### 6. Update your local `.env.local` (if stored there)

## üîê Prevention for Future

### 1. Use Pre-commit Hooks
Install git-secrets or similar:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli husky
npx husky install
```

### 2. Always Review Before Commit
```bash
git diff --cached    # Review staged changes
```

### 3. Use Environment Variables
Never hardcode credentials in documentation, even as examples.

Use placeholders like:
```
Client ID: [YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID]
Client Secret: [YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET]
```

---

## üìû If Push Still Fails

If the push is still rejected:

### Option 1: Allow the secret (temporary, not recommended)
GitHub may give you a URL to allow the push. Only use this if you're sure the credentials are test-only and will be rotated.

### Option 2: Contact me
Let me know the exact error message and I'll help fix it.

### Option 3: Check git history
Verify credentials are masked:
```bash
git show HEAD:documentation/oauth/CLERK_SDK_OAUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md | grep -A 2 "Client ID"
```

Should show `[REDACTED]` not the actual credentials.
