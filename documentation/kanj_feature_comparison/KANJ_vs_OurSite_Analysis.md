// Our site: http://localhost:3000/ (exists but different focus)
// Our polls: http://localhost:3000/polls (doesn't exist - 404)
// Our admin: http://localhost:3000/admin/polls (admin only)

## üé® Design & UX Differences

### KANJ Design Pattern:
- Clean, professional corporate look
- White background with blue accents
- Structured card-based layouts
- Executive photos with formal styling
- Traditional organizational hierarchy display

### Our Site Design Pattern (from code):

```typescript
// Modern gradient-heavy design:
className="bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-50 via-white to-cyan-50"
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-600 to-cyan-600"

// Our polls page styling:
- Gradient backgrounds (indigo/cyan)
- Modern glassmorphism effects
- Interactive hover states
- More vibrant color scheme

// ‚ö†Ô∏è INCONSISTENCY: Our site is more modern/vibrant

```

---

## üìä Functional Gaps Analysis

### 1. Membership Management

```typescript
// KANJ: ‚úÖ Members login, bylaws, member-only content
// Our site: ‚ö†Ô∏è Has user profiles but no clear membership system
// 
// RECOMMENDATION: Add membership tiers/registration like KANJ
```

### 2. Academy/Training Programs

```typescript
// KANJ: ‚úÖ AWS Cloud Practitioner Course, GenAI Workshop
// Our site: ‚ùå No educational programs section
// 
// RECOMMENDATION: Add training/academy section if relevant
```

### 3. Focus Groups

```typescript
// KANJ: ‚úÖ 4 specialized focus groups with dedicated pages
// Our site: ‚ùå No focus group structure
// 
// RECOMMENDATION: Create specialized group pages (if applicable)
```

### 4. Sponsors Section

```typescript
// KANJ: ‚úÖ Dedicated sponsors page
// Our site: ‚úÖ Has OurSponsorsSection in homepage
// 
// STATUS: ‚úÖ Our site has this feature
```

### 5. Calendar Integration

// 
// RECOMMENDATION: Add full calendar page like KANJ
```

---

## üîß Technical Implementation Gaps

### 1. Public Polls Access

```typescript
// ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE: No public polls listing page

// Current structure:
// /admin/polls ‚Üí Admin panel (requires auth)
// /polls/[id] ‚Üí Individual poll page (exists)
// /polls ‚Üí MISSING! (Should list all active polls)

// RECOMMENDATION: Create public polls listing
export default async function PublicPollsPage() {
  const polls = await fetchEventPollsServer({
    'isActive.equals': true,
    sort: 'startDate,desc'
  });
  
  return <PollList polls={polls} isPublic={true} />;
}
```

### 2. Event Registration Flow

```typescript
// KANJ: "Register/Buy" button ‚Üí Zoom/Location info
// Our site: Has event pages with Stripe payment
// 
// ‚úÖ Our site actually has MORE sophisticated payment flow
// But presentation could match KANJ's simplicity
```

### 3. Search Functionality

```typescript
// KANJ: No obvious search functionality on main site
// Our polls: ‚úÖ Has search in PollList component
// 
// ‚úÖ Our site is BETTER here
```
