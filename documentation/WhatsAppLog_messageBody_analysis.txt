IDEAL STRING LENGTH IF CHANGED TO String maxlength():
===================================================

RECOMMENDATION: String maxlength(4096)
======================================
Why 4096 characters (4KB):
1. WhatsApp messages are typically concise and focused
2. Message content is primarily text-based with minimal formatting
3. Media content is referenced, not embedded in the message body
4. 4KB accommodates comprehensive event information
5. Sufficient for detailed notifications and instructions
6. Balance between functionality and storage efficiency
7. WhatsApp's own message length limits are much smaller

Example Message Body Size Breakdown:
- Basic event confirmation: ~200-400 characters
- Detailed event information: +300-600 characters
- Venue and timing details: +200-400 characters

- Instructions and notes: +200-400 characters
- Contact information: +100-200 characters
- Links and references: +100-200 characters
