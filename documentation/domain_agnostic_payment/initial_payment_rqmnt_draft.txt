We are planning a domain agnostic payment feature for this application where this is the front end where currently we have everything set using the Stripe client side library payment setup everything is set up in the front end using the Stripeline library and the client Stripe dashboard setup Currently this is tied to a single domain where I have to set up a Stripe account for each domain I create HEAD domain address for each website which acts as a client to the single point record the SOR back end application which is located at at the path  C:\Users\gain\git\malayalees-us-site-boot.  Here is the Rest API documentation swagger at the path documentation/Swagger_API_Docs/api-docs.json for reference where the front end use this API to call the back end Also create any documentation for this research and analysis in the folder documentation/domain_agnostic_payment . Our plan is to have even if we have multiple domain web domains acting as client to the single back end application we need to have a domain agnostic payment system No matter whichever payment System like Paypal or Stripe or SE whatever you use we should have the very similar customer friendly automated workflow for payment Just wondering where all the process can takes place in the back end Thing new with the chat GPT payment feature they have recently released with Total AI features where the payments are easily handled or Google’s   Google's Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) is an open standard that creates a secure and verifiable foundation for transactions initiated by AI agents. Or Chat GPT’s  The most significant recent development regarding ChatGPT's payment protocol is the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), an open standard developed with Stripe that enables users to make purchases directly within the chat interface. This protocol powers a new feature called "Instant Checkout". 

This is a new system in addition to the existing payment models for ChatGPT subscriptions and API usage.  Right now this application has integrated ticket purchase using the Stripe Apis that is where we are focusing to make the purchase domain agnostic for the user with the latest and the greatest user experience for purchase maybe with a single button clicks and the easiest way for them.   We also need to take into consideration the factors for charity donation payment gate where people might be buying tickets for an event which is a charity fundraiser Poor people will be donating at the church an offering or votive offering during the Holy Mass using the donate button in the app  A charity donation payment gateway is a digital tool that processes online donations by transmitting a donor's payment information to a payment processor. Popular options include established platforms like PayPal, dedicated nonprofit solutions like Zeffy and Givebutter, and flexible processors like Stripe that allow for custom integration.   Please create an effective document prd.Txt or a detailed documentation with analysis and research on this the best and the easiest way to implement this solution  Which can be later breakdown into tasks using task master the components for both the back end and the front end the front end and the back end will need refactoring and changes to databases the SE cut the current SQL schema can be found at  code_html_template/SQLS/Latest_Schema_Post__Blob_Claude_11.sql
