# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Calendar Pagination
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4 ⏱️
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add always-visible pagination controls for navigating through large event datasets.
# Details:
- Create CalendarPagination.tsx component
- Implement Previous/Next/Page status pattern
- Use x-total-count header from API
- Show 'Showing X to Y of Z events'
- Gray out buttons when navigation not possible
- Ensure pagination is always visible (never conditionally hidden)

# Test Strategy:
Test pagination with various dataset sizes and verify that navigation works correctly. Verify pagination is visible in all states (loading, empty, with data).
