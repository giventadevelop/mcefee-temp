# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4 ⏱️, 5 ⏱️, 6 ⏱️, 7 ⏱️
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize calendar performance for large datasets and slow networks.
# Details:
- Implement client-side caching of fetched events
- Add debouncing for search and filters
- Optimize event rendering for large datasets
- Implement code splitting for calendar views
- Add lazy loading for event images
- Optimize bundle size

# Test Strategy:
Test with large datasets (100+ events) and verify that the calendar remains responsive. Test on slow network connections to ensure reasonable load times.
