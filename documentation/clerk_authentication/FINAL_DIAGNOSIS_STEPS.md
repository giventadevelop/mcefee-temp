# Final Diagnosis: Authorization Invalid Despite Correct Configuration

## ‚úÖ What We've Verified is CORRECT

Based on your screenshots and configuration:

1. ‚úÖ **Proxy is working**: curl test returns HTTP 200 with full Clerk JSON
2. ‚úÖ **Environment variables set in Amplify**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API` = `https://clerk.adwiise.com`
3. ‚úÖ **Clerk keys are correct**: Using LIVE production keys (`pk_live_...` and `sk_live_...`)
4. ‚úÖ **Allowed origins configured**: 3 domains whitelisted in Clerk
5. ‚úÖ **Email/password authentication enabled**: Settings configured in Clerk Dashboard
6. ‚úÖ **Google OAuth enabled**: Configured in Clerk Dashboard with Client ID

---

## üîç Remaining Possible Causes

Since all the obvious configuration is correct, the issue must be more subtle:

### Cause 1: Clerk Instance Not Recognizing Satellite Domain

Even though we configured the proxy, Clerk's backend may not have the satellite domain properly registered.

**Check**:
1. Go to: Clerk Dashboard > Configure > Domains (or Satellites)
2. Look for: `feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com`
3. Status should be: "Verified" or "Active"

**If status is "Unverified" or "Pending"**:
- Satellite domain is not recognized by Clerk
- OAuth callbacks will be rejected
- This causes `authorization_invalid`

---

### Cause 2: Google Cloud Console Missing Amplify Domain

The Google OAuth Client ID may not have the Amplify domain in its allowed origins.

**Check in Google Cloud Console**:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find: OAuth Client ID `303554160954-0nkuttb13bjlfkpsu02sbm5dr3r5bp1m`
3. Click: Edit (pencil icon)
4. Check: **"Authorized JavaScript origins"** section

**Should include**:
```
https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com
https://www.adwiise.com
https://clerk.adwiise.com
http://localhost:3000
```

**If Amplify domain is missing**:
- Add it to "Authorized JavaScript origins"
- Save
- Wait 5 minutes
- Test OAuth again

---

### Cause 3: Clerk Pro Satellite Domain Limit Reached

Clerk Pro has a limit on satellite domains.

**Check**:
1. Go to: Clerk Dashboard > Configure > Domains
2. Count: How many satellite domains are listed?
3. Clerk Pro limit: Usually 5-10 satellite domains

**If at limit**:
- Remove unused satellite domains
- Add the Amplify domain
- Retry verification

---

### Cause 4: OAuth State Parameter Mismatch

Clerk uses OAuth `state` parameter for CSRF protection. If the state doesn't match between request and callback, it fails.

**This happens when**:
- Browser cookies are blocked
- Session storage is cleared between request and callback
- Cross-domain cookie issues

**Test**:
1. Open browser in **Incognito/Private mode**
2. Go to: `https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/sign-in`
3. Try Google OAuth
4. Check if error persists

**If works in incognito**:
- Clear browser cache/cookies in normal mode
- Disable browser extensions
- Check cookie settings allow third-party cookies

## üéØ Immediate Diagnostic Actions

### Action 1: Check Clerk Dashboard Logs (Most Important)

The `clerk_trace_id` from your error can tell us exactly what went wrong:

1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.clerk.com/logs
2. **Search for**: `3dc5c6b2680813b13471b69b60a382b7`
3. **Look at the error details**: Should show specific reason for failure

**Common reasons shown in logs**:
- "Origin not allowed" ‚Üí Allowed origins issue
- "Satellite domain not verified" ‚Üí Proxy verification incomplete
- "Invalid OAuth state" ‚Üí Session/cookie issue
- "Client ID mismatch" ‚Üí Google OAuth configuration issue

**Action**: Check logs NOW and see what specific error it shows

---

### Action 2: Verify Satellite Domain Status

1. **Go to**: Clerk Dashboard > Configure > Domains (or Satellites)
2. **Find**: `feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com`
3. **Check status**

**Expected**: "Verified" or "Active" with green checkmark

**If "Unverified"**:
- Click "Verify configuration" button
- Enter proxy URL: `https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/__clerk/`
- Wait for verification

**If verification fails**:
- We already confirmed proxy works (curl test passed)
- This is a Clerk backend issue
- Contact Clerk support with evidence

---

### Action 3: Test with `clerkTraceId` in Browser Console

When the error occurs, check browser console:

```javascript
// After OAuth error, check:
localStorage.getItem('__clerk_hs')
sessionStorage.getItem('__clerk_hs_state')

// These should show Clerk session data
// If empty, session is not being preserved
```

---

## üß™ Test Sequence

Run these tests in order:

### Test 1: Check Clerk Logs for Trace ID

**Purpose**: Find exact error reason

1. Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com/logs
2. Search: `3dc5c6b2680813b13471b69b60a382b7`
3. Click on the log entry
4. Read the detailed error message

**Expected output**: Specific reason like:
- "Satellite domain not authorized"
- "Origin not in allowed list"
- "OAuth state parameter mismatch"

---

### Test 2: Verify Satellite Domain in Dashboard

**Purpose**: Confirm domain is recognized by Clerk

1. Go to: Clerk Dashboard > Configure > Domains
2. Find: Amplify domain
3. Status: Should be "Verified"

**If not verified**:
- Satellite domain not recognized
- OAuth will fail
- Must fix verification first

---

### Test 3: Check Google Cloud Console

**Purpose**: Ensure Google allows OAuth from Amplify domain

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Edit: OAuth Client ID `303554160954...`
3. Check: "Authorized JavaScript origins"
4. Verify: Amplify domain is listed

**If missing**:
- Add: `https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com`
- Save
- Wait 5 minutes
- Test OAuth again

---

### Test 4: Test OAuth in Incognito Mode

**Purpose**: Rule out browser cache/cookie issues

1. Open: Incognito/Private window
2. Go to: `https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/sign-in`
3. Try: Google OAuth
4. Check: Does error persist?

**If works in incognito**:
- Cache/cookie issue
- Clear browser data
- Disable extensions

**If still fails**:
- Configuration issue
- Not browser-related

---

### Test 5: Test on Primary Domain

**Purpose**: Determine if issue is Amplify-specific

1. Go to: `https://www.adwiise.com/sign-in` (if this domain is live)
2. Try: Google OAuth
3. Check: Does it work?

**If works on primary domain**:
- Issue is specific to satellite domain
- Satellite domain not properly configured
- Check Clerk satellite domain settings

**If fails on both**:
- General OAuth configuration issue
- Check Google Cloud Console

## üìä Diagnosis Matrix

| Clerk Logs Show | Satellite Status | Google Console | Diagnosis |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| "Origin not allowed" | Verified | Has Amplify domain | Allowed origins needs update |
| "Satellite not verified" | Unverified | Has Amplify domain | Proxy verification incomplete |
| "OAuth state mismatch" | Verified | Has Amplify domain | Cookie/session issue |
| "Client ID invalid" | Verified | Missing Amplify domain | Google Console needs update |

## üéØ Most Likely Root Cause (Based on Symptoms)

Given that:
1. ‚úÖ Environment variables are correct in Amplify
2. ‚úÖ Proxy is working (curl test passed)
3. ‚úÖ Allowed origins are configured
4. ‚ùå OAuth still fails with `authorization_invalid`

**Most likely causes** (in order of probability):

### 1. Satellite Domain Not Verified in Clerk Dashboard (60% likely)

**Symptom**: Proxy verification keeps failing in Dashboard
**Why it causes error**: Clerk backend doesn't recognize satellite domain as authorized
**Fix**: Contact Clerk support to manually verify, OR wait 2-4 hours for Pro provisioning

---

### 2. Google Cloud Console Missing Amplify Domain (30% likely)

**Symptom**: OAuth gets to Google page but fails on callback
**Why it causes error**: Google doesn't allow OAuth from unregistered origins
**Fix**: Add Amplify domain to "Authorized JavaScript origins" in Google Cloud Console

---

### 3. Clerk Pro Features Still Provisioning (10% likely)

**Symptom**: Just upgraded to Pro today, features not active yet
**Why it causes error**: Satellite domain features not enabled yet
**Fix**: Wait 2-4 hours, check Clerk billing shows "Pro" active

---
