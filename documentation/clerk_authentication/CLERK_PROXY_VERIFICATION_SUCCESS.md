  destination: 'https://clerk.adwiise.com/:path*',
}
```

## üß™ Next Steps: Test OAuth Authentication

Now that the proxy is verified, let's test the complete authentication flow:

### Test 1: Google OAuth (Primary Test)

1. **Open your Amplify domain**:
   ```
   https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/sign-in
   ```

2. **Click "Continue with Google"**

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Google OAuth popup appears ‚úì
   - Select your Google account ‚úì
   - Google authenticates successfully ‚úì
   - Redirects back to your app ‚úì
   - **NO 403 error** ‚úì
   - User is logged in ‚úì

4. **Previous Error (Should NOT appear)**:
   - ‚ùå `403 Forbidden: authorization_invalid`
   - ‚ùå `clerk.adwiise.com/v1/oauth_callback?err_code=authorization_invalid`

5. **Success Indicators**:
   - ‚úÖ Redirects to home page or dashboard
   - ‚úÖ User profile/avatar visible
   - ‚úÖ No errors in browser console (F12)
   - ‚úÖ Clerk session cookie set

---

### Test 2: Email/Password Authentication

1. **Go to sign-up page**:
   ```
   https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/sign-up
   ```

2. **Enter email and password**

3. **Check for verification code**:
   - Should arrive in email (check spam folder)
   - May take 1-30 minutes depending on email provider
   - If you configured Resend: 1-5 seconds ‚ö°

4. **Complete sign-up flow**

5. **Expected Result**:
   - User account created ‚úì
   - User is logged in ‚úì
   - No authentication errors ‚úì

---

### Test 3: Cross-Domain Session

Test that sessions work across all your domains:

1. **Sign in on Amplify domain**:
   ```
   https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/sign-in
   ```

2. **Verify session on primary domain**:
   ```
   https://www.adwiise.com/
   ```

3. **Test on localhost** (if needed):
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/
   ```

4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Session persists across domains ‚úì
   - No need to sign in again ‚úì
   - User data consistent ‚úì

## üîç Verification Checklist

After testing, verify these items:

**Proxy Configuration**:
- [x] Proxy URL configured in Clerk Dashboard
- [x] Clerk verification shows "successful"
- [x] Satellite domain status: "Verified" or "Active"
- [ ] No DNS configuration needed (proxy method used)

**OAuth Testing**:
- [ ] Google OAuth works on Amplify domain
- [ ] No 403 errors in browser console
- [ ] User can sign in with Google successfully
- [ ] OAuth callback completes without errors

**Authentication Flow**:
- [ ] Email/password sign-up works
- [ ] Verification codes arrive (email)
- [ ] Users can complete full authentication
- [ ] Sessions persist correctly

**Multi-Domain**:
- [ ] Authentication works on: `feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com`
- [ ] Authentication works on: `www.adwiise.com`
- [ ] Authentication works on: `localhost:3000` (if testing locally)
- [ ] Sessions work across all domains

## üìä Technical Details

### How the Proxy Works

```
User on Amplify domain visits /sign-in
  ‚Üì
Clerk SDK loads
  ‚Üì
Clerk SDK needs to call Clerk Frontend API
  ‚Üì
Because we're on a satellite domain, Clerk detects proxy configuration
  ‚Üì
Clerk SDK makes request to:
  https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/__clerk/v1/client
  ‚Üì
Next.js rewrites() intercepts this request
  ‚Üì
Next.js proxies to:
  https://clerk.adwiise.com/v1/client
  ‚Üì
Clerk primary domain responds ‚úì
  ‚Üì
Response flows back through proxy to user ‚úì
  ‚Üì
Authentication completes successfully ‚úì
```

### Why This Works

1. **No DNS Required**: We don't control `*.amplifyapp.com` DNS, so we can't add CNAME records
2. **Next.js Rewrites**: Proxy requests through the application layer
3. **Clerk Verification**: Clerk makes test requests to verify proxy is working
4. **Satellite Domain**: Clerk Pro allows unlimited satellite domains with proxy configuration

## üÜò If OAuth Still Fails

### Check These Items:

1. **Browser Console Errors** (F12):
   - Look for: `authorization_invalid`, `403 Forbidden`, or CORS errors
   - Should see NO authentication errors

2. **Clerk Dashboard Logs**:
   - Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com/logs
   - Filter by: OAuth or Sign-in events
   - Look for failed authentication attempts

3. **Google Cloud Console**:
   - Verify redirect URIs include Amplify domain:
     ```
     https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/sso-callback
     ```

4. **Clerk Satellite Domain Status**:
   - Should show: "Verified" or "Active" (not "Unverified")
   - If still "Unverified", click "Verify configuration" again

5. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   document.cookie.split(";").forEach(c => {
     document.cookie = c.replace(/^ +/, "").replace(/=.*/, "=;expires=" + new Date().toUTCString() + ";path=/");
   });
   // Refresh page and try again
   ```
