# Both OAuth and Email Authentication Failing - Root Cause Diagnosis

## 🚨 Critical Finding

**BOTH authentication methods are failing**:
- ❌ Google OAuth fails with `authorization_invalid` at callback
- ❌ Email/Password fails - verification codes not being sent/received

This suggests a **fundamental configuration issue** with the Clerk instance, not just OAuth or email-specific problems.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

When BOTH authentication methods fail after upgrading to Clerk Pro, there are a few likely causes:

### 1. Clerk Instance Not Fully Activated (Most Likely)

After upgrading to Pro, the production instance may need:
- ✅ Payment processed
- ✅ Plan upgrade confirmed
- ❌ **Instance provisioning still in progress**
- ❌ **Email service not yet enabled for Pro instance**

**Solution**: Wait 30-60 minutes after payment for full provisioning

---

### 2. Email Service Not Configured in Production Instance

**Problem**: The LIVE production instance may not have email delivery configured at all.

**Check**:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com/
2. **Ensure you're in PRODUCTION instance** (top-left, should show `clerk.adwiise.com`)
3. Go to: **User & Authentication** > **Email, phone, username**
4. Scroll to: **Email delivery**
5. Check what it shows:
   - ✅ "Using Clerk's email service" → Email should work (but slow)
   - ❌ "Email delivery not configured" → **THIS IS THE PROBLEM**

**Solution**:
- If not configured, Clerk may require you to set up a custom email provider for Pro accounts
- Follow the Resend setup guide in `CLERK_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_FIX.md`

---

### 3. Satellite Domain Not Properly Activated

**Problem**: The satellite domain configuration may not have fully propagated in Clerk's system after the Pro upgrade.

**Check**:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com/
2. Go to: **Configure** > **Domains** (or **Satellites**)
3. Find: `feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com`
4. Status should show:
   - ✅ **"Verified"** or **"Active"** → Configuration complete
   - ⚠️ **"Pending"** or **"Unverified"** → Still processing
   - ❌ **"Error"** or **"Failed"** → Configuration issue

**Solution**:
- If "Pending", wait 30-60 minutes
- If "Error", click "Verify configuration" again
- May need to re-add the proxy URL

---

### 4. Test/Development Instance Conflict

**Problem**: Your app might be using TEST instance keys instead of PRODUCTION keys.

**Check `.env.production`**:
```bash
# Should have LIVE keys (pk_live_... and sk_live_...)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_***
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_***

# NOT test keys (pk_test_... and sk_test_...)
# WRONG: NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

**Check AWS Amplify Environment Variables**:
1. Go to: AWS Amplify Console
2. Your App > **Environment variables**
3. Verify these are set to LIVE keys (not test keys)

**Solution**: Ensure LIVE keys are deployed to Amplify

---

### 5. Clerk Pro Features Not Yet Available

**Problem**: Even though you upgraded, there may be a delay before Pro features are available.

**Symptoms**:
- Satellite domain shows "Feature not available"
- Email delivery shows rate limits
- OAuth providers show restrictions

**Solution**:
- Check Clerk billing: https://dashboard.clerk.com/billing
- Verify plan shows as "Pro" (not "Free")
- Wait 1 hour after payment confirmation
- Contact Clerk support if still restricted after 1 hour

---

## 🎯 Immediate Action Steps

### Step 1: Verify Clerk Pro Upgrade Completed

1. **Go to Clerk Billing**: https://dashboard.clerk.com/billing
2. **Check**:
   - Plan should show: **"Pro"** (not "Free")
   - Status should show: **"Active"** (not "Pending")
   - Next billing date should be shown

**If still showing "Free"**:
- Payment may not have processed
- Check your payment method
- Contact Clerk support

---

### Step 2: Check Clerk Production Instance Status

1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard**: https://dashboard.clerk.com/
2. **Top-left corner**: Should show **PRODUCTION** or `clerk.adwiise.com`
3. **If showing TEST** (`humble-monkey-3.clerk.accounts.dev`):
   - Click the instance selector dropdown
   - Switch to **PRODUCTION** instance
   - All configuration must be in PRODUCTION, not TEST

---

### Step 3: Verify Email Delivery Configuration

1. **Go to**: Clerk Dashboard > **User & Authentication** > **Email, phone, username**
2. **Scroll to**: **Email delivery** section
3. **Check configuration**:
   - Should show: "Using Clerk's email service" OR custom provider configured
   - Should NOT show: "Not configured" or error messages

**If email delivery not configured**:
- Clerk Pro may require custom email provider
- Set up Resend (5 minutes): https://resend.com/
- Follow guide: `CLERK_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_FIX.md`

---

### Step 4: Send Test Email from Clerk Dashboard

1. **Go to**: Email delivery section (from Step 3)
2. **Click**: "Send test email" (if available)
3. **Enter**: Your email address
4. **Check**: Email should arrive within 1-5 minutes

**If test email fails**:
- Email service not working
- Must configure custom provider (Resend recommended)

---

### Step 5: Check Clerk Dashboard Logs

1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.clerk.com/logs
2. **Look for recent events**:
   - `session.created` - Should see attempts
   - `email.sent` - Should see for verification codes
   - `oauth.callback` - Should see for Google OAuth attempts
   - Any error events

**Common error patterns**:
- No `email.sent` events → Email service not configured
- `oauth.error` events → OAuth configuration issue
- `session.error` events → General authentication issue

---

## 🧪 Diagnostic Test Sequence

Run these tests in order to isolate the issue:

### Test 1: Verify Clerk Instance is Accessible

Open browser and visit:
```
https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/__clerk/v1/environment
```

**Expected**: JSON response with environment data
**If 404 or error**: Proxy configuration issue (should be fixed already)

---

### Test 2: Check Sign-In Page Loads

Visit:
```
https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/sign-in
```

**Expected**:
- Sign-in form appears
- "Continue with Google" button visible
- Email/password fields visible

**If blank page or error**:
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- May indicate Clerk SDK not loading properly

---

### Test 3: Test Email/Password Sign-Up (Primary Test)

1. **Go to**: `https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/sign-up`
2. **Enter**: New email address and password
3. **Click**: Sign up
4. **Wait**: 5 minutes for verification code

**Expected behaviors**:

**Scenario A: Email Service Working**
- ✅ "Verification code sent" message appears
- ✅ Email arrives within 1-5 minutes
- ✅ Can enter code and complete sign-up

**Scenario B: Email Service Not Configured** (Your current situation)
- ✅ "Verification code sent" message appears
- ❌ No email arrives (even after 10+ minutes)
- ❌ Spam folder also empty
- **Diagnosis**: Email delivery not configured in Clerk

**Scenario C: Authentication Blocked**
- ❌ Error message appears immediately
- ❌ "Sign up failed" or similar error
- **Diagnosis**: More serious configuration issue

---

### Test 4: Check Clerk Logs for Email Events

1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.clerk.com/logs
2. **Filter**: Last 15 minutes
3. **Look for**: `email.sent` events

**If NO email.sent events**:
- Email service not sending at all
- Must configure email provider
- Critical: Email delivery completely broken

**If email.sent events exist**:
- Emails ARE being sent
- Problem is with delivery or spam filtering
- Check spam folder thoroughly
- Try different email provider (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)

---

## 🎯 Most Likely Root Cause (Based on Symptoms)

Given that:
- ✅ OAuth gets to Google page (Clerk SDK is working)
- ✅ Proxy verification succeeded (satellite domain configured)
- ❌ OAuth fails at callback (`authorization_invalid`)
- ❌ Email verification codes not arriving

**Most Likely Cause**:

### Clerk Pro Instance Not Fully Provisioned

After upgrading from Free to Pro, Clerk needs to:
1. Process payment ✓
2. Upgrade plan ✓
3. Enable Pro features (may take 30-60 minutes) ⏳
4. Provision email service for new plan ⏳
5. Update satellite domain permissions ⏳

**Solution**: Wait 1 hour after upgrade confirmation, then test again

---

### Alternative Cause: Email Service Requires Custom Provider on Pro

Some Clerk Pro plans require you to configure your own email provider (Clerk doesn't provide default email service for Pro).

**Check**: Clerk Dashboard > Email delivery
- If says "Not configured" or "Email service not available"
- **Solution**: Set up Resend (free tier, 5 minutes setup)

---

## ✅ Recommended Fix Priority

### Priority 1: Configure Email Delivery (Solves Email/Password Auth)

**Why**: Email verification is completely broken, easier to fix than OAuth

**Steps**:
1. Sign up for Resend: https://resend.com/ (100 free emails/day)
2. Get API key
3. Configure in Clerk Dashboard > Email delivery
4. Send test email to verify
5. Test sign-up flow

**Time**: 10 minutes
**Impact**: Email/password authentication will work immediately

---

### Priority 2: Wait for Pro Provisioning (May Solve OAuth)

**Why**: OAuth might start working once Pro features are fully enabled

**Steps**:
1. Wait 1 hour after upgrade confirmation
2. Check Clerk billing shows "Pro" plan active
3. Verify satellite domain status is "Verified"
4. Test OAuth again

**Time**: 1 hour wait
**Impact**: OAuth might work without additional changes

---

### Priority 3: Verify Google Cloud Console (If OAuth Still Fails)

**Why**: Only do this if OAuth still fails after Steps 1 & 2

**Steps**:
1. Follow guide: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_OAUTH_VERIFICATION.md`
2. Add Amplify domain to "Authorized JavaScript origins"
3. Save and wait 5 minutes
4. Test OAuth

**Time**: 10 minutes
**Impact**: OAuth should work if this was the issue
