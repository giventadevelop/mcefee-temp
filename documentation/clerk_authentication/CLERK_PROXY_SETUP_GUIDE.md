# Clerk Proxy Setup Guide - Satellite Domain Configuration

## ‚úÖ Congratulations on Upgrading to Clerk Pro!

You now have access to **satellite domain** support, which allows you to use Clerk authentication across multiple domains without DNS configuration.

---

## üéØ What Was Done

### File Updated: `next.config.mjs`

Added Clerk proxy configuration to the `rewrites()` function:

```javascript
// Configure rewrites for Clerk proxy (satellite domain support)
async rewrites() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/__clerk/:path*',
      destination: 'https://frontend-api.clerk.services/__clerk/:path*',
    },
  ];
},
```

**What this does**:
- Proxies all requests from `/__clerk/*` to Clerk's Frontend API
- Allows Clerk to verify domain ownership without DNS changes
- Enables satellite domain authentication

---

## üìã Complete Setup Steps

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes ‚úÖ

```bash
# Add the modified file
git add next.config.mjs

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add Clerk proxy configuration for satellite domain support"

# Push to repository
git push origin feature_Common_Clerk
```

### Step 2: Wait for Amplify to Deploy

1. Go to: **AWS Amplify Console**
2. Your App > **Deployments**
3. Wait for the build to complete (usually 5-10 minutes)
4. Verify status shows: **"Deployed"** ‚úì

### Step 3: Configure Proxy in Clerk Dashboard

1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard**: https://dashboard.clerk.com/

2. **Navigate to Satellites**:
   - Ensure you're in **Production** instance (top-left)
   - Go to: **Configure** > **Domains** or **Satellites**
   - Find: `feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com`

3. **Set Proxy Configuration**:
   - Click: **"Set proxy configuration"** button
   - A modal will appear (as shown in your screenshot)

4. **Enter Proxy URL**:
   ```
   https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/__clerk/
   ```

   **Important**: Include the trailing slash `/` after `__clerk/`

5. **Click "Use proxy"** button

### Step 4: Verify Configuration

1. Clerk will now attempt to verify the proxy
2. It should show: **"Verified"** ‚úì (may take 1-2 minutes)
3. Status should change from **"Unverified"** to **"Active"** or **"Verified"**

---

## üß™ Testing the Setup

### Test 1: Verify Proxy Endpoint

Open browser and visit:
```
https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/__clerk/v1/environment
```

**Expected Response**:
- Should return JSON data from Clerk's API ‚úì
- Should NOT return 404 error
- Should NOT return Next.js 404 page

**If you get 404**:
- Proxy rewrites not working yet
- Wait for Amplify deployment to complete
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Test 2: Test OAuth on Amplify Domain

1. **Go to sign-in page**:
   ```
   https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/sign-in
   ```

2. **Click "Continue with Google"**

3. **Expected Result**:
   - Google OAuth popup appears ‚úì
   - User authenticates with Google ‚úì
   - Redirects back to your app ‚úì
   - **NO 403 error** ‚úì
   - User is logged in successfully ‚úì

### Test 3: Test Email/Password Authentication

1. **Try email/password sign-up** on Amplify domain
2. **Verification code should arrive**:
   - If you configured Resend: 1-5 seconds ‚ö°
   - If using Clerk default: 10-30 minutes üêå
3. **Complete authentication flow** ‚úì

## üîç How Clerk Proxy Works

### The Flow:

```
User visits Amplify domain
  ‚Üì
App loads Clerk SDK
  ‚Üì
Clerk SDK needs to call: clerk.adwiise.com/v1/client
  ‚Üì
Because we're on a satellite domain, Clerk SDK detects proxy
  ‚Üì
Clerk SDK calls: feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/__clerk/v1/client
  ‚Üì
Next.js rewrites() forwards to: frontend-api.clerk.services/__clerk/v1/client
  ‚Üì
Clerk API responds ‚úì
  ‚Üì
Authentication works across all domains ‚úì
```

### Why This Method?

**Traditional DNS Method**:
- Requires adding CNAME record: `clerk.feature-common-clerk ‚Üí frontend-api.clerk.services`
- ‚ùå Not possible with `*.amplifyapp.com` domains (you don't control DNS)

**Proxy Method** (What we're using):
- Uses Next.js rewrites to proxy requests
- ‚úÖ Works with any domain (including Amplify URLs)
- ‚úÖ No DNS changes needed
- ‚úÖ Clerk verifies by making test requests to `/__clerk/` path

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Proxy Verification Fails in Clerk

**Error**: Clerk shows "Unable to verify proxy configuration"

**Solutions**:

1. **Check Amplify Deployment**:
   - Ensure build completed successfully
   - Check build logs for errors
   - Verify app is accessible

2. **Verify Proxy URL**:
   - Must end with `/__clerk/` (with trailing slash)
   - Must use HTTPS
   - Must match exact Amplify URL

3. **Test Proxy Manually**:
   - Visit: `https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/__clerk/v1/environment`
   - Should return JSON, not 404
   - If 404, proxy rewrites not working

4. **Check next.config.mjs**:
   - Verify rewrites section is correct
   - Ensure file is `.mjs` extension
   - Verify syntax (no typos)

5. **Wait and Retry**:
   - Amplify deployment can take 5-10 minutes
   - Clerk verification can take 1-2 minutes
   - Try clicking "Verify configuration" again

---

### Issue 2: 404 Error on /__clerk/ Path

**Error**: Visiting `/__clerk/v1/environment` returns Next.js 404 page

**Solutions**:

1. **Deployment Not Complete**:
   - Check Amplify Console > Deployments
   - Wait for build to finish
   - Redeploy if needed

2. **Caching Issue**:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try in incognito/private window
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

3. **next.config.mjs Not Applied**:
   - Verify file was committed
   - Check git status: `git status`
   - Verify it's pushed: `git log --oneline -5`
   - Redeploy in Amplify Console

4. **Syntax Error in next.config.mjs**:
   - Check build logs in Amplify Console
   - Look for syntax errors
   - Test build locally: `npm run build`

---

### Issue 3: OAuth Still Returns 403

**Error**: Google OAuth still fails with 403 `authorization_invalid`

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify Domain in Clerk**:
   - Go to: Clerk Dashboard > Domains/Satellites
   - Ensure Amplify domain shows as "Verified" ‚úì
   - If "Unverified", proxy setup incomplete

2. **Check Google Cloud Console**:
   - Redirect URI must include Amplify domain
   - Should have: `https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/sso-callback`
   - Add if missing

3. **Clear Clerk Session**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console on your app:
   document.cookie.split(";").forEach(c => {
     document.cookie = c.replace(/^ +/, "").replace(/=.*/, "=;expires=" + new Date().toUTCString() + ";path=/");
   });
   // Refresh and try OAuth again
   ```

4. **Check Clerk Logs**:
   - Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com/logs
   - Look for OAuth errors
   - Should show successful authentication

---

### Issue 4: Email Verification Codes Not Arriving

**Solutions**:

1. **Check Clerk Email Logs**:
   - Dashboard > Logs > Filter: "Email"
   - Should show `email.sent` events

2. **If Using Clerk Default Email**:
   - Check spam folder
   - Wait 10-30 minutes (Clerk's default is slow)
   - Add `noreply@clerk.com` to safe senders

3. **Configure Custom Email Provider** (Recommended):
   - Sign up: https://resend.com/ (free tier available)
   - Get API key
   - Configure in: Clerk Dashboard > Email delivery
   - Emails will arrive in 1-5 seconds ‚ö°
