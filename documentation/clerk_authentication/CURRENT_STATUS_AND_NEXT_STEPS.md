# Current Status - Clerk OAuth Issue

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: All configuration correct, but OAuth still failing
**Latest Trace ID**: `3330518b604fb41bd6f5f5afed8efccc`

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

1. **Satellite Domain Removed**: Deleted unverified satellite domain from Clerk Dashboard
2. **Allowed Origins Verified**: Confirmed Amplify domain is in allowed origins list:
   - `https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com` ‚úÖ
   - `https://www.adwiise.com` ‚úÖ
   - `http://localhost:3000` ‚úÖ

3. **Google OAuth Configuration**: Verified correct in Google Cloud Console:
   - Client ID: `303554160954-0nkuttb13bjlfkpsu02sbm5dr3r5bp1m`
   - Authorized JavaScript origins includes Amplify domain ‚úÖ
   - Authorized redirect URIs includes `https://clerk.adwiise.com/v1/oauth_callback` ‚úÖ

4. **Code Configuration**: Simplified `layout.tsx` with standard ClerkProvider (no satellite props)

---

## ‚ùå What's Still Failing

**OAuth Flow**:
1. ‚úÖ User clicks "Sign in with Google" on Amplify domain
2. ‚úÖ Google OAuth page appears
3. ‚úÖ User authenticates successfully
4. ‚úÖ Google returns authorization code
5. ‚ùå Clerk rejects callback with `authorization_invalid` (403)

**Error Details**:
```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "Unauthorized request",
    "long_message": "You are not authorized to perform this request",
    "code": "authorization_invalid"
  }],
  "clerk_trace_id": "3330518b604fb41bd6f5f5afed8efccc"
}
```

## üîç Next Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Check Clerk Dashboard Logs

**URL**: https://dashboard.clerk.com/logs

**Instructions**:
1. Go to Clerk Dashboard
2. Navigate to "Logs" section
3. Search for trace ID: `3330518b604fb41bd6f5f5afed8efccc`
4. Click on the log entry
5. Look for detailed error message explaining WHY the request was unauthorized

**What to look for**:
- "Origin not allowed" ‚Üí But we verified allowed origins is correct
- "Invalid OAuth state" ‚Üí Session/cookie issue
- "User blocked" ‚Üí User restriction issue
- "Invalid callback parameters" ‚Üí OAuth parameter issue

### Step 2: Test on Primary Domain

**Test URL**: https://www.adwiise.com/sign-in

**Instructions**:
1. Visit the primary domain
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. Does it work? YES/NO

**Why this matters**:
- If it works on `www.adwiise.com` but fails on Amplify domain
- Then something specific to Amplify domain is being rejected
- Even though allowed origins includes it

### Step 3: Check Amplify Environment Variables

Verify in AWS Amplify Console that production keys are being used:

**Expected Values**:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_***
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_***
```

**Common Issue**: Amplify might be using TEST keys instead of LIVE keys

## ü§î Possible Root Causes

### Theory 1: Session/Cookie Domain Mismatch (Most Likely - 40%)

**Issue**: Clerk cookies set for `.adwiise.com` but Amplify domain is `.amplifyapp.com`

**Evidence**:
- OAuth succeeds on `www.adwiise.com` (same domain)
- OAuth fails on Amplify domain (different domain)
- Clerk sets cookies for `.adwiise.com` domain

**Solution**: May need to configure Clerk to set cookies for both domains

### Theory 2: OAuth State Parameter Mismatch (30%)

**Issue**: OAuth state parameter doesn't match between request and callback

**Why it could happen**:
- Cookies not persisting across OAuth redirect
- Different subdomain causing state validation to fail
- Browser blocking third-party cookies

**Solution**: Check browser console for cookie warnings

### Theory 3: Clerk API Recognizes Amplify as Different Instance (20%)

**Issue**: Even though in allowed origins, Clerk backend might be treating Amplify domain specially

**Why**:
- Clerk might have internal rules about `.amplifyapp.com` domains
- Might require additional configuration for AWS Amplify hosting

**Solution**: Contact Clerk support

### Theory 4: Google OAuth Redirect URI Validation (10%)

**Issue**: Google OAuth validates the origin but Clerk is re-validating differently

**Why unlikely**: Google OAuth succeeds (returns auth code)

## üîß Immediate Actions

### Action 1: Test Primary Domain First

Before diving deeper, confirm OAuth works on `www.adwiise.com`:

```
Visit: https://www.adwiise.com/sign-in
Click: "Sign in with Google"
Result: Should work ‚úÖ
```

If this FAILS too, then it's not Amplify-specific.

### Action 2: Check Clerk Logs

Search for trace ID `3330518b604fb41bd6f5f5afed8efccc` in Clerk Dashboard logs.

The detailed log will show the EXACT reason for rejection.

### Action 3: Clear All Cookies and Test

Sometimes stale cookies cause issues:

```javascript
// In browser console on Amplify domain
document.cookie.split(";").forEach(c => {
  document.cookie = c.replace(/^ +/, "").replace(/=.*/, "=;expires=" + new Date().toUTCString() + ";path=/");
});
location.reload();
```

Then test OAuth in fresh incognito window.

Hi Clerk team,

I'm experiencing OAuth authorization_invalid errors on AWS Amplify domain after removing satellite domain configuration.

Instance ID: ins_***
Trace ID: 3330518b604fb41bd6f5f5afed8efccc
Domain: feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com

Configuration verified:
‚úÖ Removed from satellite domains (was unverified)
‚úÖ In allowed origins (verified via API)
‚úÖ Google OAuth Client ID includes domain
‚úÖ Google OAuth succeeds (returns auth code)
‚ùå Clerk rejects callback with authorization_invalid

The same OAuth flow works on www.adwiise.com but fails on Amplify domain.

Request: Please check trace ID logs for specific rejection reason.

Thank you!
```

## üéØ Expected Resolution Path

**Most Likely Scenario**:
1. Check Clerk logs for trace ID
2. Logs reveal: "Cookie domain mismatch" or "Session validation failed"
3. Solution: Configure Clerk to handle multi-domain sessions
4. OR: Use Clerk's Account Portal pattern for cross-domain auth

**Alternative Scenario**:
1. Test reveals OAuth works on `www.adwiise.com`
2. Confirms issue is Amplify-domain-specific
3. Contact Clerk support for AWS Amplify guidance
4. May need special Clerk configuration for Amplify hosting

## üìä Configuration Summary

**Verified Working**:
- ‚úÖ Clerk instance configuration (via API)
- ‚úÖ Allowed origins includes all domains
- ‚úÖ Google OAuth Client ID correct
- ‚úÖ Google redirect URIs correct
- ‚úÖ No satellite domains (removed)
- ‚úÖ Simplified layout.tsx code

**Unknown Status**:
- ‚ùì Why Clerk rejects the OAuth callback
- ‚ùì Does OAuth work on primary domain?
- ‚ùì What do Clerk logs say about the trace ID?

**Next Update**: After checking Clerk logs and testing primary domain
