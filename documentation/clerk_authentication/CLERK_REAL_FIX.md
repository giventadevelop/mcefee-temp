# Clerk 400 Error - The Real Problem

## The Issue

The error `clerk.adwiise.com/v1/environment 400` means that **`clerk.adwiise.com` is not a valid Clerk API endpoint**.

Your publishable key `pk_live_***_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` decodes to `clerk.adwiise.com`, but this domain is either:
1. Not configured as a Clerk Frontend API
2. Not the actual endpoint your Clerk instance uses
3. A custom domain that's not properly set up

## What You Need to Find

In your Clerk Dashboard, you need to find the **ACTUAL Frontend API URL** your instance uses.

### Where to Find It

1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard**: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. **Click on your instance** at the top (currently shows "nextjs-template")
3. **Go to**: Developers → API Keys (in left sidebar)
4. **Look for a field called**: "Frontend API" or "Clerk Frontend API"

It should show something like:
- `humble-monkey-3.clerk.accounts.dev` (for test/dev instances)
- `clerk-production-xxxx.clerk.accounts.com` (for production)
- OR if using custom domain, the actual configured domain

## The Two Possibilities

### Possibility 1: You're Using the WRONG Keys

Your `.env.production` has **LIVE keys**:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_***_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_***_CLERK_SECRET_KEY_HERE
```

But maybe these keys are from a DIFFERENT Clerk instance or are invalid.

Your backend has **TEST keys**:
```bash
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_***
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_***
```

The test key decodes to: `humble-monkey-3.clerk.accounts.dev`

**Try using the TEST keys instead:**

In AWS Amplify, **REPLACE**:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_***
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_***
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_***
```

This will connect to the `humble-monkey-3.clerk.accounts.dev` instance which should work.

### Possibility 2: clerk.adwiise.com Needs to be Configured

If you really want to use the LIVE keys and `clerk.adwiise.com` as a custom domain, you need to:

1. **In Clerk Dashboard** → **Developers** → **Domains**
2. **Set up `clerk.adwiise.com` as a custom Frontend API domain**
3. **Add DNS records** for `clerk.adwiise.com` pointing to Clerk's servers

But this is advanced configuration and likely not set up.

## Immediate Solution: Use Test Keys

**In AWS Amplify Environment Variables**, change to TEST keys:

```bash
# Use TEST keys (matching backend)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_***
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_***
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_***

# Keep these
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/

# DO NOT SET (leave empty or delete)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=
```

Then **Redeploy**.

## How to Check Which Keys Are Valid

You can test the keys by checking if the API endpoint responds:

```bash
# Test with LIVE key
curl https://clerk.adwiise.com/v1/client?_clerk_js_version=4.73.14 \
  -H "Origin: https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com"

# Test with TEST key (should work)
curl https://humble-monkey-3.clerk.accounts.dev/v1/client?_clerk_js_version=4.73.14 \
  -H "Origin: https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com"
```

The one that returns a valid response (not 400) is the correct endpoint.

## Understanding the Keys

### LIVE Keys (Currently Not Working):
```
pk_live_***_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
      └─ decodes to: clerk.adwiise.com
```
This suggests a production Clerk instance with custom domain `clerk.adwiise.com`, but it's returning 400, meaning it's not properly configured or doesn't exist.

### TEST Keys (Should Work):
```
pk_test_***
      └─ decodes to: humble-monkey-3.clerk.accounts.dev
```
This is a standard Clerk test instance that should work out of the box.

## Recommended Action

**Switch to TEST keys for now** to get authentication working, then later figure out the LIVE keys situation.

### In AWS Amplify:

**Change FROM**:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_***_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_***_CLERK_SECRET_KEY_HERE
```

**Change TO**:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_***
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_***
```

**Redeploy** and test again.

## Why This Should Work

1. ✅ TEST keys point to `humble-monkey-3.clerk.accounts.dev` (a real Clerk instance)
2. ✅ Backend already uses TEST keys (so they'll match)
3. ✅ Standard Clerk instances work with any domain (domain-agnostic by default)
4. ✅ No custom domain configuration needed

## After It Works

Once authentication is working with TEST keys, you can:

1. Contact Clerk support about the LIVE keys
2. Ask them why `clerk.adwiise.com` returns 400
3. Get proper LIVE keys if needed
4. Or properly configure `clerk.adwiise.com` as a custom domain

## Testing the Fix

After changing to TEST keys and redeploying:

1. Visit: `https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/sign-in`
2. Browser console should show:
   - ✅ Requests to `humble-monkey-3.clerk.accounts.dev` (not `clerk.adwiise.com`)
   - ✅ No 400 errors
   - ✅ Sign-in form loads properly

## The Bottom Line

**The problem is NOT with domain configuration - it's with invalid/misconfigured Clerk keys.**

The LIVE keys (`pk_live_*`) are pointing to `clerk.adwiise.com` which doesn't exist or isn't configured.

**Quick fix: Use TEST keys that point to a real Clerk instance.**

**Action Required:**
1. Change Amplify to use TEST keys
2. Redeploy
3. Test
4. Authentication should work!
