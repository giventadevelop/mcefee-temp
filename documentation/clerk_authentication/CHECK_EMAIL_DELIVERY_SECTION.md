# Check Email Delivery Configuration - Critical Missing Step

## 🎯 What We See in Your Screenshot

Your screenshot shows the **email authentication settings** are configured:
- ✅ Sign-up with email: Enabled
- ✅ Verify at sign-up: Enabled
- ✅ Email verification code: Enabled
- ✅ Sign-in with email: Enabled

**BUT** - This is just the authentication METHOD configuration. This doesn't show the **email delivery service** configuration.

## ❗ Critical Missing Section: "Email Delivery"

On the SAME page you're viewing (User & authentication > Email), you need to **scroll down** to find the **"Email delivery"** or **"Email service"** section.

### What to Look For:

Scroll down on the current page until you see a section titled one of these:
- **"Email delivery"**
- **"Email service"**
- **"Email & SMS"**
- **"Email configuration"**

## 🔍 What You Should See in Email Delivery Section

### Scenario A: Email Service Configured (Good)
```

## 🎯 Immediate Action Steps

### Step 1: Find Email Delivery Section

On the **same page** you showed in the screenshot:

- This should work (but can be slow)
- Click **"Send test email"** button
- Enter your email address
- Check if you receive the test email within 5 minutes
- **If test email arrives**: Email is working, OAuth is the only issue

**If you see "No email service configured"** or similar:
- This is the problem
- You MUST set up an email provider
- Follow the Resend setup below

**If you don't see any "Email delivery" section at all**:

## 🎯 Why Both Auth Methods Are Failing

Based on your configuration screenshot, here's the likely root cause:

### Email/Password Auth Failing:
```
User enters email/password
  ↓
Clerk tries to send verification code
  ↓
Clerk checks: "Is email service configured?"
  ↓
❌ NO email service configured
  ↓
Clerk fails silently (or shows generic error)
  ↓
No email sent, user stuck waiting
```

### OAuth Failing:
```
User clicks "Sign in with Google"
  ↓
Google authenticates successfully
  ↓
Google redirects to: clerk.adwiise.com/v1/oauth_callback
  ↓
Clerk processes callback
  ↓
Clerk tries to verify/create user account
  ↓
Clerk checks: "Can I send verification email if needed?"
  ↓
❌ NO email service configured
  ↓
Clerk rejects the entire auth flow with authorization_invalid
```

**The pattern**: Both methods need email service to be configured, even if just for account creation/recovery purposes.

## ✅ What This Will Fix

Once you configure email delivery:

**Email/Password Authentication**:
- ✅ Verification codes will be sent instantly (1-10 seconds)
- ✅ Users can complete sign-up flow
- ✅ Users can sign in with email/password
- ✅ Password reset emails will work

**Google OAuth** (might also fix):
- ✅ May start working if email service was blocking account creation
- ✅ Clerk can send welcome/verification emails if needed
- ⚠️ If still fails, then it's the Google Cloud Console issue
