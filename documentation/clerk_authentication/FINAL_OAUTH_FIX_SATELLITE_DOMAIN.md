# Final OAuth Fix - Satellite Domain Verification Issue

## 🎯 Current Situation

**What's Working**:
- ✅ Proxy endpoint returns JSON: `/__clerk/v1/environment`
- ✅ Google OAuth config correct: Amplify domain in "Authorized JavaScript origins"
- ✅ Google redirect URIs correct: Amplify domain in redirect URIs
- ✅ Clerk allowed_origins configured: 3 domains whitelisted

**What's Failing**:
- ❌ OAuth still returns `authorization_invalid`
- ❌ Satellite domain shows "Unverified" in Clerk Dashboard

**Root Cause**: Even though the proxy works and Google OAuth is configured correctly, **Clerk won't process OAuth from an "Unverified" satellite domain**.

---

## 🔍 The Real Issue

Clerk has a **two-layer security check** for satellite domains:

### Layer 1: Technical Verification (Proxy Working)
- ✅ Can Clerk access `/__clerk/` endpoints? **YES** - We confirmed this works

### Layer 2: Dashboard Verification Status
- ❌ Has Clerk marked the satellite domain as "Verified"? **NO** - Shows "Unverified"

**Even if Layer 1 works, if Layer 2 shows "Unverified", Clerk will reject OAuth!**

This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized domains from using your Clerk instance.

## ✅ Solution: Contact Clerk Support for Manual Verification

Since:
1. The proxy IS working (we proved it with curl tests)
2. Clerk's automatic verification keeps failing
3. But Clerk's verification system has a bug/issue

**You need Clerk support to manually verify the satellite domain.**

Hi Clerk team,

I need help with satellite domain verification for production instance.

Instance ID: ins_***
Satellite Domain: feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com
Proxy URL: https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/__clerk/

Issue:
- Proxy is working correctly (/__clerk/v1/environment returns valid JSON)
- Automatic verification in Dashboard keeps failing with "Clerk Frontend API cannot be accessed"
- But the proxy IS accessible (verified with curl tests)
- OAuth failing with authorization_invalid because domain shows as "Unverified"

Evidence proxy is working:
curl https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/__clerk/v1/environment
Returns full JSON configuration (HTTP 200)

Can you manually verify this satellite domain? Or help debug why automatic verification is failing?

Thank you!
```

**Option 2: Clerk Dashboard Support** (24-48 hour response)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com/support
2. Click "Contact Support"
3. Include same information as above

## 🔄 Alternative Workaround: Wait for Pro Provisioning

Since you JUST upgraded to Clerk Pro today, there might be a provisioning delay:

### Try Again in 24 Hours:

1. **Wait**: 24 hours from when you upgraded to Pro
2. **Try verification again**: Go to Clerk Dashboard > Domains > Satellites
3. **Click**: "Verify configuration" for Amplify domain
4. **Might work** after full Pro provisioning completes

---

## 🎯 Temporary Solution: Use Primary Domain

While waiting for satellite domain verification, you can use your primary domain for production:

### Deploy to www.adwiise.com

1. **Update environment variables** in Amplify to point to `www.adwiise.com`
2. **Test OAuth** on primary domain
3. **Should work** because `www.adwiise.com` doesn't need satellite verification

## 📊 Technical Explanation

### Why OAuth Fails Even Though Everything Looks Correct:

```
User clicks "Sign in with Google" on Amplify domain
  ↓
Clerk SDK initiates OAuth
  ↓
Google OAuth page appears ✓
  ↓
User selects account ✓
  ↓
Google redirects to: clerk.adwiise.com/v1/oauth_callback
  ↓
Clerk receives callback
  ↓
Clerk checks: What domain initiated this OAuth?
  ↓
Domain: feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com
  ↓
Clerk checks: Is this domain in allowed_origins? YES ✓
  ↓
Clerk checks: Is this domain in Google OAuth config? YES ✓
  ↓
Clerk checks: Is this a satellite domain? YES
  ↓
Clerk checks: Is satellite domain VERIFIED? NO ❌
  ↓
Clerk rejects: authorization_invalid
  ↓
Error shown to user
```

**The "Unverified" status is blocking OAuth, even though everything else is correct.**

---

## 🔑 Key Point

**You've done everything right!** The configuration is correct:
- ✅ Proxy works
- ✅ Google OAuth configured
- ✅ Environment variables set
- ✅ Allowed origins configured

**The only issue is Clerk's automatic verification system is failing**, even though the proxy works when we test it directly.

This is a **Clerk platform issue**, not your configuration issue.

## 📋 What to Send to Clerk Support

Include this information when contacting support:

```
Production Instance ID: ins_***
Satellite Domain: feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com
Proxy URL: https://feature-common-clerk.d1508w3f27cyps.amplifyapp.com/__clerk/

Test Results:
- Proxy endpoint test: HTTP 200 ✓
- Returns valid JSON ✓
- All OAuth configuration correct ✓
- Automatic verification in Dashboard: FAILS ❌
- Manual curl test: WORKS ✓

Error:
- OAuth callback returns: authorization_invalid
- Latest trace ID: 9125ef35c1674659aef6c875b4a9e7bb

Request: Please manually verify satellite domain or help debug verification failure
```

## ⏰ Expected Timeline

| Action | Time |
|--------|------|
| Contact Clerk Discord | Now |
| Clerk support response | 30 min - 2 hours |
| Manual verification | 5 minutes (by Clerk) |
| Test OAuth again | 2 minutes |
| **Total** | **~1-3 hours** |

## 🎉 After Clerk Verifies

Once Clerk support manually verifies your satellite domain:

1. ✅ Dashboard will show "Verified" (green checkmark)
2. ✅ OAuth will work immediately
3. ✅ Email/password will work
4. ✅ All authentication methods will function
5. ✅ No more `authorization_invalid` errors

---

## 💡 Why This Happened

**Clerk's automatic verification system** sometimes fails due to:
- Network issues from Clerk's verification servers
- Timing issues during Pro plan provisioning
- Strict SSL/TLS certificate validation
- Geographic routing issues
- CDN propagation delays

**But our manual tests prove the proxy works**, so Clerk can manually verify it.

## 🆘 If You Can't Wait for Clerk Support

### Quick Test: Use Primary Domain

To unblock yourself immediately:

1. **Change Amplify environment variable**:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.adwiise.com
   ```

2. **Test OAuth** on `www.adwiise.com` instead of Amplify domain

3. **Should work immediately** because primary domain doesn't need satellite verification

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-22
**Status**: WAITING - Need Clerk support to manually verify satellite domain
**Priority**: HIGH - Configuration is correct, just need Clerk's manual approval
