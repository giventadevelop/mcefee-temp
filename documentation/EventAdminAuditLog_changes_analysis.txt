EVENT ADMIN AUDIT LOG CHANGES FIELD ANALYSIS
============================================

Entity: EventAdminAuditLog
Field: changes
Current Data Type: TextBlob

WHAT THIS FIELD MEANS:
======================
The changes field stores detailed audit trail information about what modifications were made
to event management records. This includes comprehensive before/after data, field-level changes,
administrative actions, and supporting context that provides a complete audit trail for
compliance, security, and troubleshooting purposes.

COMMON USE CASES:
=================

Audit Log Changes Examples:
- Field-level modifications to event details
- User permission changes and role updates
- Ticket type modifications and pricing changes
- Event capacity and registration rule updates
- Payment processing and refund actions
- User profile and subscription modifications
- Event media and content updates
- Administrative policy changes
- Security and access control modifications
- Bulk operation logs and batch changes

Example Changes Content:
{
  "tableName": "EventDetails",
  "recordId": "12345",
  "action": "UPDATE",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T14:30:00Z",
  "adminUserId": "admin_001",
  "changes": {
    "capacity": {
      "before": 100,
      "after": 150,
      "reason": "Increased capacity due to high demand"
    },
    "startDate": {
      "before": "2024-04-15",
      "after": "2024-04-20",
      "reason": "Venue availability change"
    },
    "maxGuestsPerAttendee": {
      "before": 2,
      "after": 3,
      "reason": "Customer feedback and policy update"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123"
  }
}

IDEAL STRING LENGTH IF CHANGED TO String maxlength():
====================================================

RECOMMENDATION: String maxlength(8192)
======================================
Why 8192 characters (8KB):
1. Audit logs need comprehensive before/after data
2. JSON structure adds significant overhead
3. Multiple field changes require detailed documentation
4. Metadata and context information adds length
5. Security and compliance requirements need full audit trails
6. Future extensibility for complex change tracking
7. Balance between comprehensive logging and storage efficiency

Example Changes Size Breakdown:
- Basic change structure: ~500-1000 characters
- Field-level changes (3-5 fields): +1000-2000 characters
- Before/after values: +500-1500 characters
- Change reasons and context: +500-1000 characters
- Metadata and security info: +500-1000 characters
- JSON formatting overhead: +500-1000 characters
- Future extensibility: +500-1000 characters
- Total recommended: 8KB (8192 characters)

ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
============================

Conservative Approach:
- String maxlength(4096) - 4KB
- Sufficient for basic audit logging
- Good for simple change tracking
- More storage efficient

Balanced Approach:
- String maxlength(8192) - 8KB
- Handles comprehensive audit trails
- Room for detailed change documentation
- Reasonable storage usage

Aggressive Approach:
- String maxlength(16384) - 16KB
- Maximum flexibility for complex audits
- Room for extensive change tracking
- Higher storage usage

FINAL RECOMMENDATION: String maxlength(8192)
============================================
This provides:
✅ Sufficient space for comprehensive audit trails
✅ Room for detailed before/after data
✅ Multiple field change tracking
✅ Metadata and context information
✅ Security and compliance requirements
✅ Future extensibility
✅ Reasonable database storage usage

RATIONALE:
==========
- 8KB accommodates most real-world audit scenarios
- Provides adequate detail for compliance requirements
- Handles complex multi-field changes
- Suitable for security and audit purposes
- Storage impact is reasonable for critical audit data
- Balances comprehensive logging with efficiency

JDL SYNTAX CHANGE:
==================
Current: changes TextBlob
Recommended: changes String maxlength(8192)

IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
=============================
1. Implement structured change logging format (JSON)
2. Enable change categorization by table and action type
3. Support change search and filtering for compliance
4. Implement change data validation and sanitization
5. Consider change log retention policies
6. Enable change log export for audit purposes
7. Support change log compression for long-term storage
8. Implement change log monitoring and alerting

AUDIT LOG BEST PRACTICES:
=========================
1. Log all administrative actions and changes
2. Include before/after values for all modifications
3. Document reasons and context for changes
4. Include user authentication and session information
5. Maintain consistent JSON structure for parsing
6. Implement change log retention and archival
7. Enable real-time monitoring of critical changes
8. Provide comprehensive search and reporting
