## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Follow Dependency Order
Tasks must be implemented in dependency order. Each task depends on the completion of its prerequisite tasks.

### 2. Database Schema
The system is based on these core tables:
- `tenant_organization`: Main tenant information
- `tenant_settings`: Tenant-specific configurations
- Foreign key relationship: `tenant_settings.tenant_id` references `tenant_organization.tenant_id`

### 3. Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15+ with App Router
- **Backend**: API routes with proxy handlers
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with existing schema
- **Authentication**: Clerk with role-based access control
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with existing design system

### 4. Code Organization
- Place tenant management pages under `/admin/tenant-management/`
- Create proxy API handlers in `/api/proxy/tenant-*`
- Use server components for data fetching
- Implement client components for interactive features
- Follow existing patterns from other admin modules

### 5. Security Considerations
- Only super administrators can access tenant management
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use proxy API handlers for all backend operations
- Maintain audit logs for all administrative actions

## Getting Started

### 1. Review the PRD
Read through `PRD.md` to understand the complete requirements and business context.

### 2. Examine Generated Tasks
Review `tasks.json` and individual task files in the `tasks/` directory.

### 3. Start with Task 1
Begin implementation with "Setup Tenant Management Infrastructure" as it has no dependencies.

### 4. Follow Implementation Phases
Work through tasks in phases to ensure proper foundation before building UI components.

### 5. Test Each Task
Use the provided test strategy for each task to ensure proper functionality.

## Task Management

### Regenerating Tasks
If you need to modify the task structure, edit `taskmaster.cjs` and run:
```bash
node taskmaster.cjs
```

### Updating Task Status
As you complete tasks, update the `status` field in `tasks.json`:
- `pending`: Not started
- `in-progress`: Currently being worked on
- `done`: Completed and tested
- `blocked`: Waiting for dependencies

### Adding New Tasks
If new requirements emerge, add them to the `generateTasks()` function in `taskmaster.cjs` and regenerate.

## Integration Points

### Existing Admin System
- Integrate with existing admin navigation at `/admin`
- Follow existing UI patterns and component structure
- Use existing authentication and authorization systems

### Database Integration
- Leverage existing database schema
- Use existing proxy API patterns
- Follow established data validation practices

### UI Components
- Extend existing admin dashboard components
- Use consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- Follow responsive design patterns

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- [ ] All CRUD operations work correctly
- [ ] Authentication and authorization are properly implemented
- [ ] Dashboard loads and displays tenant data

### Phase 2 Success
- [ ] Tenant creation form works end-to-end
- [ ] Tenant editing interface is fully functional
- [ ] All validation rules are enforced

### Phase 3 Success
- [ ] Settings management interface is complete
- [ ] Subscription management is functional
- [ ] Stripe integration is working

### Phase 4 Success
- [ ] Tenant deactivation/activation works
- [ ] Platform administration features are complete
- [ ] Monitoring and analytics are functional

### Phase 5 Success
- [ ] Export and reporting features work
- [ ] Performance is optimized
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] User acceptance testing is complete

## Support and Resources

### Documentation
- Review existing admin module implementations for patterns
- Check Next.js documentation for App Router features
- Refer to database schema in `code_html_template/SQLS/`

### Code Examples
- Look at existing admin pages for implementation patterns
- Review proxy API handlers for backend patterns
- Examine existing forms and components for UI patterns

### Questions and Issues
- Document any questions or issues in the task files
- Update task details as implementation progresses
- Maintain clear communication about blockers or dependencies

## Conclusion

This Tenant Management System will provide the foundation for scalable multi-tenant operations. By following the structured approach outlined in these tasks, you'll build a robust, secure, and user-friendly system that supports the platform's growth and provides administrators with powerful tenant management capabilities.

Remember to:
- Follow the dependency order strictly
- Test each task thoroughly before moving to the next
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns
- Document any deviations or additional requirements
- Keep the task status updated as you progress

Good luck with the implementation!
