# Post-Authentication Redirect - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Feature**: Smart redirect after successful authentication

---

## What Was Implemented

Users are now redirected intelligently after sign-in or sign-up based on where they came from or where they intended to go.

---

## Redirect Logic

### Priority Order

1. **Query Parameter** (`?redirect=/dashboard`)
   - Highest priority
   - Example: `https://example.com/sign-in?redirect=/dashboard`

2. **Session Storage** (set by ProtectedRoute)
   - User tried to access protected page
   - Example: User visits `/admin/settings` → redirected to sign-in → after login goes back to `/admin/settings`

3. **Default** (`/` - home page)
   - When user navigates directly to sign-in/sign-up

---

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: Direct Sign-In
**Action**: User goes to `/sign-in` directly
**Result**: Redirected to `/` (home page)

### Scenario 2: Protected Page Access
**Action**: User tries to access `/dashboard` but not logged in
**Result**: After sign-in, redirected to `/dashboard` (their original destination)

### Scenario 3: Deep Link
**Action**: User clicks link: `/sign-in?redirect=/event/123`
**Result**: After sign-in, redirected to `/event/123`

---

## Security Features

✅ **Redirect Loop Prevention**
- Cannot redirect to `/sign-in` or `/sign-up` (would cause infinite loop)
- Falls back to home page if invalid

✅ **Open Redirect Prevention**
- Next.js `router.push()` only accepts relative paths
- No external URLs can be used

---

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

**SignInForm.tsx**:
```typescript
// Get redirect URL (priority: query > session > default)
const queryRedirect = searchParams.get('redirect');
const sessionRedirect = sessionStorage.getItem('redirect_after_login');

let redirectUrl = '/'; // Default

if (queryRedirect && queryRedirect !== '/sign-in' && queryRedirect !== '/sign-up') {
  redirectUrl = queryRedirect;
} else if (sessionRedirect && sessionRedirect !== '/sign-in' && sessionRedirect !== '/sign-up') {
  redirectUrl = sessionRedirect;
}

sessionStorage.removeItem('redirect_after_login');
router.push(redirectUrl);
```

**SignUpForm.tsx**:
- Same logic as SignInForm

**ProtectedRoute.tsx**:
- Already had logic to store intended destination in sessionStorage
- No changes needed

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Email Verification
```
User clicks: https://example.com/sign-in?redirect=/profile&verified=true
After sign-in: https://example.com/profile?verified=true
```

### Example 2: Admin Panel
```
Admin visits: https://example.com/admin/users (protected)
→ Redirected to: /sign-in
→ After sign-in: /admin/users (back to where they wanted to go)
```

### Example 3: Event Registration
```typescript
// In event component
if (!user) {
  router.push(`/sign-in?redirect=/event/${eventId}/register`);
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Test Cases

1. **Direct Sign-In**
   - Navigate to `/sign-in`
   - Sign in
   - Should redirect to `/` (home)

2. **Protected Route**
   - Sign out
   - Navigate to `/dashboard`
   - Should redirect to sign-in
   - Sign in
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard`

3. **Query Parameter**
   - Navigate to `/sign-in?redirect=/profile`
   - Sign in
   - Should redirect to `/profile`

4. **Loop Prevention**
   - Navigate to `/sign-in?redirect=/sign-in`
   - Sign in
   - Should redirect to `/` (not `/sign-in`)

5. **Priority**
   - Navigate to protected page (sets sessionStorage)
   - Manually add query param to URL
   - Sign in
   - Should redirect to query param (not sessionStorage)

---

## Configuration

### Change Default Redirect

To change from home page to dashboard:

**SignInForm.tsx and SignUpForm.tsx**:
```typescript
let redirectUrl = '/dashboard'; // Changed from '/'
```

---

## Summary

✅ **Before**: Always redirected to `/dashboard` after login

✅ **After**: Smart redirect based on:
- Query parameter (highest priority)
- Protected route destination (ProtectedRoute)
- Home page (default)

✅ **Benefits**:
- Better user experience
- Seamless authentication flow
- Works with deep links
- Secure and flexible

---

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR TESTING
**Documentation**: See `AUTHENTICATION_REDIRECT_GUIDE.md` for complete details

## Quick Reference

```typescript
// Redirect to specific page after sign-in
<Link href="/sign-in?redirect=/dashboard">Sign In</Link>

// In component
router.push(`/sign-in?redirect=${pathname}`);

// Protected route (automatic)
<ProtectedRoute>
  <DashboardPage />
</ProtectedRoute>
```
