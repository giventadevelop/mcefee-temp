- Enables tenant-specific business logic and user experience improvements

COMMON USE CASES:
=================

Custom CSS Examples:
- Brand color schemes and typography
- Custom button styles and hover effects

IDEAL STRING LENGTH IF CHANGED TO String maxlength():
====================================================

CUSTOM CSS RECOMMENDATION: String maxlength(8192)
================================================
Why 8192 characters:
1. CSS files can be substantial (typical custom themes: 2-8KB)
2. Multiple CSS rules and selectors add up quickly
3. Responsive design requires media queries
4. Vendor prefixes and browser-specific rules
5. CSS custom properties and variables
6. Future extensibility for complex themes

Example CSS size breakdown:
- Basic theme: ~1-2KB
- Responsive design: +1-2KB
- Custom components: +1-2KB
- Browser compatibility: +1-2KB
- Future additions: +1-2KB
- Total recommended: 8KB (8192 characters)

CUSTOM JAVASCRIPT RECOMMENDATION: String maxlength(16384)
========================================================
Why 16384 characters:
1. JavaScript code is typically longer than CSS
2. Custom functions and business logic
3. Error handling and validation
4. Third-party API integrations
5. Event handlers and DOM manipulation
6. Future extensibility for complex features

Example JavaScript size breakdown:
- Basic functionality: ~2-4KB
- Form validation: +1-2KB
- API integrations: +2-4KB
- Event handling: +1-2KB
- Error handling: +1-2KB
- Future features: +2-4KB
- Total recommended: 16KB (16384 characters)

ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
============================

Conservative Approach:
- customCss: String maxlength(4096) - 4KB
- customJs: String maxlength(8192) - 8KB

Balanced Approach:
- customCss: String maxlength(8192) - 8KB
- customJs: String maxlength(16384) - 16KB

Aggressive Approach:
- customCss: String maxlength(16384) - 16KB
- customJs: String maxlength(32768) - 32KB

FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
======================

RECOMMENDED: Balanced Approach
==============================
customCss: String maxlength(8192)
customJs: String maxlength(16384)

This provides:
✅ Sufficient space for comprehensive customizations
✅ Room for complex themes and functionality
✅ Future extensibility
✅ Reasonable database storage usage
✅ Handles most tenant customization needs
✅ Balances functionality with storage efficiency

RATIONALE:
==========
- CSS is typically more concise than JavaScript
- 8KB CSS allows for substantial theme customization
- 16KB JavaScript accommodates complex business logic
- Both sizes provide room for future enhancements
- Storage impact is reasonable for multi-tenant systems

JDL SYNTAX CHANGES:
===================
Current:
customCss TextBlob,
customJs TextBlob

Recommended:
customCss String maxlength(8192),
customJs String maxlength(16384)

IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
=============================
1. Validate CSS/JS syntax before storing
2. Sanitize user input to prevent XSS
3. Consider CSS/JS minification for storage efficiency
4. Implement versioning for custom code changes
5. Provide code editor with syntax highlighting
6. Enable/disable custom code per tenant
7. Cache compiled/minified versions for performance
